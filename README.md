# Kickstarter Analysis Project

This repository contains the final project done for my graduate data analytics course at Willamette University. The objective of the project was to complete an analysis on supplied Kickstarter crowdfunding data, answering macro-level questions, telling a clear story, and uncovering trends in the data which could be could be acted upon. In 72 hours, I was able to clean, wrangle, explore, and provide actionable reccomendations for stakeholders in the data.

## About

#### The Goal

The scope of this project was aimed at addressing, but not limited to:

- Which categories contain the greatest quantity of campaigns? The least?
- Is there any time trend in terms of the number of campaigns launched?
- Which project categories were tied to the most successful campaigns? The most unsuccessful campaigns? (And how do you define “successful”?)

#### The Data

The data for this project comes from the Jonathan Leland, via the ICPSR, and covers historical Kickstarter crowdfunding data from 2009-2020. The data is not included in this repository, but the data codebook can be viewed in Kickstarter-Codebook-ICPSR.pdf file.

#### The Product

The final product was an academic research paper investigating the questions of interest and identifying niche crowdfunding dependencies, cyclical trends, and accionable insight. The final file is too large for the GitHub Repository, view the report at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/165BUPHQxiadvfNl5dlZyS8Q99O7uhhP6/view?usp=sharing).

## Skills

Beyond the usual data science workflow in other pinned projects in my repository, this project was completed in a 72 hour window. I was able to complete end end-to-end analysis showcasing every step of the data science workflow. This required organization and planning, a deep knowledge of the analytical process, and hard work.
